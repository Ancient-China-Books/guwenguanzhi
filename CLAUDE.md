# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an EPUB e-book project for "古文觀止", a classical Chinese bibliography text. The repository contains a complete EPUB structure with HTML content, CSS styling, fonts, and images.

## Repository Structure

- `META-INF/` - EPUB metadata and container configuration
- `OEBPS/` - Main EPUB content directory
  - `Text/` - HTML chapter files (numbered 0000101.html to 0086802.html)
  - `Styles/` - CSS stylesheets and JavaScript for styling and navigation
  - `Fonts/` - Chinese fonts (FSung series and Noto Serif SC)
  - `Images/` - Book illustrations and diagrams
  - `content.opf` - EPUB package file (large, contains all content metadata)
  - `toc.ncx` - Navigation control file for table of contents
- `README.md` - Project description
- `index.html` - Web version index file
- `mimetype` - EPUB mime type specification

## Build Commands

### Build EPUB files
```bash
# Build vertical (traditional) layout EPUB
zip -r sikutiyao-vst.epub META-INF mimetype OEBPS

# Build horizontal layout EPUB
sed -i 's/vertical-rl/horizontal-tb/g' OEBPS/Styles/*.css
sed -i 's/page-progression-direction="rtl"/page-progression-direction="ltr"/g' OEBPS/content.opf
zip -r sikutiyao.epub META-INF mimetype OEBPS
```

### Development setup
```bash
# Install required tools
sudo apt-get install -y zip

# Validate EPUB structure
unzip -t sikutiyao.epub
```

## Content Architecture

- **HTML Structure**: Each chapter is a separate HTML file with XHTML 1.1 formatting
- **CSS Styling**:
  - `stylesheet.css` - Main typography and layout styles
  - `page_styles.css` - Page-specific styling
  - Supports both vertical (traditional Chinese) and horizontal reading modes
- **JavaScript**: `main.js` provides highlighting functionality for cross-references
- **Fonts**: Custom Chinese fonts included for proper character rendering

## Text Direction Support

The project supports both reading directions:
- **Vertical (竪排)**: Traditional Chinese vertical right-to-left layout
- **Horizontal (橫排)**: Modern horizontal left-to-right layout

Layout switching is handled via CSS `writing-mode` property changes during build.

## CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated EPUB building on push to master
- **GitLab CI**: Alternative CI pipeline for GitLab hosting
- Builds create both vertical and horizontal layout EPUBs
- Automatic releases published to GitHub Releases

## Content Editing

When editing content:
- HTML files are in `OEBPS/Text/` directory
- Maintain XHTML 1.1 compliance
- Images should be referenced from `../Images/` relative path

## File Size Considerations

- `content.opf` and `toc.ncx` are very large files (1-2MB)
- Use grep or limit parameters when reading these files
- HTML text files are reasonably sized and can be read normally

## Translation Guidelines

When translating content for this project:
0. **HTML Structure**: Translation content should be added as an independent paragraph `<p class="translation">` immediately after the original paragraph, not included within the original paragraph's `<p>` tag
1. **Translation Placement**: Translations should be placed paragraph by paragraph after each original paragraph, using orange/brown text color as shown in the reference image
2. **Font Size**: Translation text should be one size smaller than the original text
3. **Style Consistency**: Translation styles should be unified through CSS modifications in `OEBPS/Styles/` directory, with HTML files in `Text/` directory referencing these styles
4. **Language Style**: Translations MUST use Simplified Chinese (简体中文) and pursue accuracy, faithfulness, and elegance (信达雅), conforming to modern Chinese conventions. Use modern vernacular Chinese (现代白话文) and avoid mixing classical Chinese expressions. Use `opencc -c t2s` command to verify that all translation text is in simplified Chinese
5. **Formatting**: Book titles, place names, and person names should use proper symbols, with consistent typography formatting
6. **Source Preservation**: Never modify the original text (even if the original text contains errors; if there are questions or unclear parts, ask the user)
7. **Paragraph Structure**: Do not modify the original paragraph formatting and structure
8. **Blockquote Removal**: Before translating, if there are blockquote tags in the HTML, these tags should be removed and replaced with regular paragraph (`<p>`) tags
9. **Translation Quality**: Think carefully and thoroughly when translating - consider context, meaning, and appropriate modern Chinese expressions
10. **Jiazhu Exclusion (CRITICAL)**: NEVER translate jiazhu (annotation) content marked with `class="zhu"` or `class="kindle-cn-para-left"`. These are scholarly annotations and commentary that must remain in original form. Always identify and exclude this content BEFORE beginning translation work.
11. **Quality Control (MANDATORY)**: After completing the translation, you MUST perform a secondary review to verify that the original text and translation match properly. Check for:
    - Accuracy of meaning and context
    - Proper rendering of specialized terms and names
    - Consistency with translation guidelines
    - Any mismatched or missing content
12. **Punctuation**: Translations MUST use punctuation exactly as it appears in the original text (翻译使用的标点符号悉遵原文). This includes:
    - Chinese quotation marks: Use 「」 (not "" or "")
    - Chinese period: Use 。 (not .)
    - Chinese comma: Use ， (not ,)
    - Chinese book title marks: Use 《》 (not italics or other formatting)
    - Chinese enumeration comma: Use 、 (not ,)
    - Chinese semicolon: Use ； (not ;)
    - Chinese colon: Use ： (not :)
    - Chinese question mark: Use ？ (not ?)
    - Chinese exclamation mark: Use ！ (not !)
    - DO NOT mix Chinese and Western punctuation marks in the same text
13. **Font Subsetting (MANDATORY)**: After translating any HTML files, you MUST ALWAYS execute the following command to regenerate the subset font: `cat OEBPS/Text/*.html | pyftsubset ~/.local/share/fonts/ttf/Noto/NotoSerifSC-Medium.ttf --text-file=/dev/stdin --output-file=OEBPS/Fonts/NotoSerifSC-Medium.otf`. This step is REQUIRED and must not be skipped. After running this command, commit the updated font file along with the translation.

## Translation Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)

When asked to translate any HTML file, follow this strict workflow:

### Phase 1: Pre-Translation Analysis (MANDATORY)
1. **Read the HTML file** to understand overall structure and content
2. **Identify annotation content** using Grep tool to find ALL instances of:
   - `class="zhu"` (classical annotations)
   - `class="kindle-cn-para-left"` (commentary content)
3. **Mark these as "DO NOT TRANSLATE"** - create a mental/written list of content to exclude
4. **Identify translatable paragraphs** - only content in regular `<p class="calibre5">` tags without annotation classes

### Phase 2: Translation Execution
5. **Translate only the identified translatable content** following all translation guidelines
6. **Skip all annotation content** identified in Phase 1 - do not translate anything marked with excluded classes
7. **Add translations as independent paragraphs** with `<p class="translation">` class

### Phase 3: Quality Control & Finalization
8. **MANDATORY Secondary Review**: Verify that:
   - No annotation content (`class="zhu"` or `class="kindle-cn-para-left"`) was translated
   - All regular paragraphs have accurate translations
   - Translation quality meets all guidelines
9. **Run font subsetting command**: `cat OEBPS/Text/*.html | pyftsubset ~/.local/share/fonts/ttf/Noto/NotoSerifSC-Medium.ttf --text-file=/dev/stdin --output-file=OEBPS/Fonts/NotoSerifSC-Medium.otf`
10. **Single commit**: Include both translated HTML file and updated font file

**CRITICAL**: Phase 1 annotation identification is MANDATORY and must be completed before any translation work begins. Failure to follow this workflow may result in incorrect translation of annotation content.

14. **Commit Strategy**: During translation tasks, make only ONE commit after all work is complete. Do not commit intermediate changes. Only commit when you have finished all translation work, quality review, and font subsetting. The single commit should include both the translated HTML file and the updated font file.
